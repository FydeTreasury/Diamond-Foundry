# Diamond Proxy Template for Foundry
## Description
This is a reference implementation for EIP-2535 Diamonds by [Nick Mudge](www.github.com/mudgen) translated for use in foundry . To learn about other implementations go here: https://github.com/mudgen/diamond

Note: The loupe functions in DiamondLoupeFacet.sol MUST be added to a diamond and are required by the EIP-2535 Diamonds standard.

Note: In this implementation the loupe functions are NOT gas optimized. The facets, facetFunctionSelectors, facetAddresses loupe functions are not meant to be called on-chain and may use too much gas or run out of gas when called in on-chain transactions. In this implementation these functions should be called by off-chain software like websites and Javascript libraries etc., where gas costs do not matter.
